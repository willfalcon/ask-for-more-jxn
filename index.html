          <p>For over twenty years, we’ve brought schools and communities together to improve public education in  our city. Whether you’re a parent, teacher, or community member, we believe everyone has something to offer to better the lives of our Jackson Public Schools children.</p>

          <h2>New Name,  Years of Impact</h2>

          <p>It is with excitement that we announce  our organization’s new name:  Ask For More Jackson.</p>
          <p>Ask For More is one of our oldest and most successful programs, empowering educators to support the wellbeing of each child through the student’s entire progression through school. Teachers and principals engage parents, students and community partners in the process, and that sense of shared responsibility radically improves how schools operate. All of our existing programs and relationships remain, and we look to the future to continue to meet the challenges that face the students, families, and educators in our public school district.</p>

          <h2>Ubuntu</h2>
          <p>Our vision for Jackson’s children is embodied by the philosophy of Ubuntu “I am because we are.” No individual can succeed if someone in the village is left behind. Our village of Jacksonians  is beautifully diverse in race, age, gender, opportunity, and ability.</p>
          <p>Not every person invested in our mission is a parent; nor should they be. No matter who we are or where we come from, the trajectory of our community’s future runs through our public schools. We can do more. We deserve more. With unity and the children in mind, we will ask for more, and we will expect more, for their sake.
